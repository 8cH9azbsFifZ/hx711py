# HX711 for Raspbery Py
----
Quick code credited to [underdoeg](https://github.com/underdoeg/)'s [Gist HX711.py](https://gist.github.com/underdoeg/98a38b54f889fce2b237).
I've only made a few modifications on the way the captured bits are processed and to support Two's Complement, which it didn't.

Instructions
------------
Check example.py to see how it works.
